# Humpback Marketplace

> The first search engine for LLMs built on trust and sustainable information economics. We're creating a marketplace that fairly values quality information while enabling the next generation of source-grounded AI.

## 🐋 About Humpback

Humpback is revolutionizing how information flows between content creators and AI systems by establishing the first search ecosystem built around trust and sustainable economics. Our platform creates a fair and transparent environment where:

- Content creators and data providers can monetize their high-quality information directly
- LLM developers can access reliable, authorized content for building source-grounded AI assistants
- Users receive more accurate, verifiable AI responses with proper attribution
- Quality information is properly valued and compensated

We believe in transparency and trust, which is why we've made Humpback's core infrastructure open source. This allows the community to:

- Verify how we retrieve and rank information
- Understand our content quality assessment mechanisms
- Trust that creator compensation is fair and accurate
- Contribute to improving the platform's reliability and fairness

> **Note**: While our codebase is open source, the information and data stored in our services remains proprietary to Humpback and our content creators. This protects our creators' intellectual property rights and ensures they maintain control over their content.

### Why Humpback?

Current web search APIs and content scraping methods face several critical challenges:

1. **Creator Compensation**: Content creators and publishers often go uncompensated for their work, leading to legal disputes and copyright issues
2. **AI Hallucination**: LLM developers struggle with hallucinations due to unreliable data sources and paywall workarounds
3. **Search Quality**: Traditional search results are often polluted by SEO manipulation and sponsored content

Humpback solves these problems by creating a direct marketplace where:

- Information providers are fairly compensated through a credit system
- LLM developers get access to high-quality, structured data
- Content attribution is built into the system
- Quality is incentivized over SEO manipulation
